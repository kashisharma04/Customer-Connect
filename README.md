# Customer-Connect-System

## Project Overview 
This Node.js application provides a RESTful API for managing customer information, including details, images, updates, insertions, and deletions. The API is designed to be secure and includes authentication for sensitive operations.

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/kashisharma04/Customer-Connect.git`
2. Install dependencies:`npm install`
3. Start the Node.js server: `npm start`

## API Endpoints
